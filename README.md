## About The Project

A Redux shopping cart app frontend in React is a user interface that displays a list of products available for purchase, allows users to add items to a shopping cart, and facilitates the checkout process. The Redux architecture is used to manage the state of the shopping cart and handle user actions, such as adding or removing items from the cart. The frontend in React provides a responsive and intuitive interface for users to interact with the app on different devices.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Description

A Redux shopping cart app with frontend in React and backend in Express is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse a catalog of products, add items to their shopping cart, and complete a purchase. The app is built using the React library for the frontend and Express framework for the backend. Users can add and remove items from their cart, and the app updates the cart total in real-time. The backend manages the application logic, including the retrieval and storage of product information and shopping cart data. It communicates with the frontend using RESTful APIs to retrieve and send data.<br/>

The app uses the Redux architecture to manage the state of the shopping cart, which helps keep the code organized and maintainable. The Redux store is connected to the backend using middleware that handles asynchronous actions, such as fetching product data and updating the shopping cart.<br/>

Overall, the Redux shopping cart app with frontend in React and backend in Express provides a seamless and secure shopping experience for users.<br/>
